At Sabernex, we prioritise the privacy and safety of our users,
including children under the age of 13. This Privacy Policy outlines how
our Barcode Scanner collects, uses, and protects user information.
Please read this policy carefully to understand how we handle your data.

1.  Information Collection: Our Barcode Scanner does not collect any
    user data. We do not gather personal information such as names,
    addresses, or contact details. We solely focus on providing a secure
    and efficient barcode scanning experience.

2.  Use of Scanned Data: The data obtained through barcode scanning is
    solely used to display the relevant information associated with the
    scanned barcode. We do not store or transmit this data to any
    external servers or third parties.

3.  Children\'s Privacy: We are committed to protecting the privacy of
    children. Our Barcode Scanner is safe for use by individuals under
    the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
    children. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us
    with personal information, we will promptly delete it from our
    records.

4.  Security Measures: We employ industry-standard security measures to
    protect the integrity and confidentiality of your data. We utilise
    appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard
    against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction
    of data.

5.  Third-Party Services: Our Barcode Scanner does not integrate any
    third-party services or libraries that collect user data. However,
    please note that other apps or websites you may visit through
    scanned barcodes may have their own privacy policies, which are
    beyond our control. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of
    these third-party services before providing any personal
    information.

6.  Changes to Privacy Policy: We reserve the right to modify or update
    this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes made will be reflected
    in this policy with the revised date of effect. We encourage users
    to review this policy periodically for any updates.
